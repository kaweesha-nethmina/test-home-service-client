# Support System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the support system for the Home Service application, covering all three user roles: Customer, Provider, and Admin.

## Customer Side (Already Existed)
- **Support Page**: Allows customers to submit complaints and view their complaint history
- **Notifications Page**: Displays notifications for the authenticated user
- **Ratings Page**: Enables customers to rate completed services

## Provider Side (Already Existed)
- **Support Page**: Allows providers to view and manage complaints assigned to them
- **Feedback Page**: Shows providers their ratings and feedback from customers (replaces separate Ratings Page)
- **Bookings Page**: Allows providers to view and manage their service bookings

## Admin Side (Newly Created)
### 1. Support Dashboard (`/app/admin/support/page.tsx`)
- Overview of support system statistics
- Quick links to complaints and notifications management
- Summary of recent activity

### 2. Complaints Management (`/app/admin/support/complaints/page.tsx`)
- View all complaints from all users
- Update complaint status (open, in-progress, resolved, closed)
- Assign complaints to specific users
- Filter and sort complaints

### 3. Notifications Management (`/app/admin/support/notifications/page.tsx`)
- View all system notifications
- Create new notifications for specific users or all users
- Categorize notifications by type (info, success, warning, error)

### 4. Feedback Management (`/app/admin/feedback/page.tsx`)
- View all customer feedback across the platform
- Update feedback status (pending, approved, rejected, completed)
- Monitor service ratings and reviews

### 5. Ratings Overview (`/app/admin/ratings/page.tsx`)
- Placeholder page for future implementation
- Will display all ratings across the platform
- Requires backend endpoint: GET /api/admin/ratings

## Services Updated
### Admin Service (`services/adminService.ts`)
Added methods for support management:
- `getAllComplaints()`
- `updateComplaintStatus(id, data)`
- `getAllNotifications()`
- `createNotification(data)`
- `getAllFeedbacks()`
- `getFeedbackById(id)`
- `updateFeedback(id, data)`
- `deleteFeedback(id)`
- `getAllRatings()`

### Support Service (`services/supportService.ts`)
Added method for admin ratings:
- `getAllRatings()`

### Provider Service (`services/providerService.ts`)
Added methods for booking management:
- `getBookings()`
- `getBookingById(id)`
- `updateBookingStatus(id, status)`
- `deleteBooking(id)`

## API Endpoints Integrated
All endpoints from the support system API documentation have been integrated:

### Complaints
- POST /api/support/complaints (Customer)
- GET /api/support/complaints (Customer, Provider, Admin)
- PUT /api/support/complaints/:id (Provider, Admin)

### Ratings
- POST /api/support/ratings (Customer)
- GET /api/support/ratings/provider/:id (Provider)
- GET /api/support/ratings/me (Customer)

### Notifications
- POST /api/support/notifications (Admin)
- GET /api/support/notifications (Customer, Provider)
- PUT /api/support/notifications/:id/read (Customer, Provider)

### Feedback

- GET /api/feedback/customer (Customer)
- GET /api/feedback/provider (Provider)

## Future Implementation Needs
1. Backend endpoint for admin ratings: GET /api/admin/ratings
2. Additional filtering and search capabilities for complaints and notifications
3. Export functionality for support data
4. Automated notification system for complaint status changes
5. Calendar view for provider bookings

## Technical Notes
- All admin pages require authentication with admin role
- Proper error handling and loading states implemented
- Responsive design following existing UI patterns
- TypeScript types used consistently
- Reusable components from the existing component library
